Subject: Application for the Full Stack Engineer Position at Enigma

Dear Hiring Manager at Enigma,

I am writing to express my interest in the Full Stack Engineer position that I found on Otta.com. With over a year of professional full-stack engineering experience, almost a decade of programming experience, and the self-investment I made in pursuing an advanced degree, I believe that I have the experience and the drive to excel in this position and contribute significantly to your team.


The values that your company upholds strongly resonate with me. Particularly, your emphasis on teamwork and setting ambitious goals matches the kind of work environment that I thrive in. I am especially drawn to your dedication towards unlocking the potential of data to have a positive impact on the real world.

The remote working culture at Enigma appeals to me, as it reflects a level of pragmatism and respect for your employees that I think is essential in the modern workplace. I appreciate that your company recognizes the importance of work-life balance and encourages employees to maintain passions outside of work. This gives me confidence that I could settle comfortably into a role with you and contribute to a long-lasting mutually-beneficial working relationship.

I am excited by the prospect of joining Enigma and contributing to your mission of engineering the most reliable and accessible source of data about small businesses. I believe I could bring a unique perspective to your team and I look forward to the possibility of discussing my candidacy further.
