			<p>It's happened to the best of us, hasn't it? You're planning an absolute banger of a party, everyone's gonna be there, it's going to be amazing. You've got everything in order: the drinks, the food, the activities... and then it dawns on you: you forgot to hire a DJ. Now you have two days to hire a good DJ who's in your price range. What are you going to do?</p>
			<h2>
				Introducing DJFindr
			</h2>
			<img alt="STOCK PHOTO" src="images/dj2.jpg"/>
			<p>DJFindr is the revolutionary new application from I-101Group1 inc. Inspired by "swipe" applications like Tinder, DJFindr can quickly pair <i>you</i> with the <i>right</i> DJ. No more navigating novice Wordpress sites, Facebook pages, and Twitter feeds trying to figure out how to hire somebody; just swipe right on their DJ profile on DJFindr and they'll be notified that you'd like to hire them! After receiving a right swipe, a DJ has two days to get back to you, or we disable ads in the app for a week <i> at no cost to you!</i></p>
