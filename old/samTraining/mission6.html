			For mission 6, mammaw wants you to install the window air conditioners. "I'm about to die in this house," she says. She also very explicitly said that Isaiah shouldn't help you with this because he is incompetent and doesn't know how air conditioners work, so obviously he can't help with things like this. She said that, not me, so, that's rough.
