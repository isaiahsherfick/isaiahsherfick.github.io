			Web Art
		</h1>
		<p>This is a collection of "webpages as art," which is something I'll leave open to your anterpretation entirely. It's an art form that I really enjoy. Not that I think I'm any good at it. Enjoy if it's your cup of tea. I don't have any social media to post this to, so feel free to post it anywhere you please. No copyright bullshit reserved, do what thou wilt.</p>
