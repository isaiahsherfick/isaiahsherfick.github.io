				About Me	
			</h3>
				<p class="aboutMe">
				I'm a prospective software engineer / computer professional from Martinsville, Indiana. 
				I'm currently completing my undergraduate Computer Science degree at Indiana University. When I complete my BS, I intend on getting my MS and pursuing a PhD. As a
				Junior, I feel like I've gained enough experience to pursue research opportunities and internships.

			<h3>
				Specific areas of study to date
			</h3>
				<p class="aboutMe">
				I've done a lot of work in object-oriented programming and C programming. 
				I'm also an avid Linux user and have a basic grasp on some networking concepts. 
				I'm extremely familiar with Windows and Unix based systems, and I've worked in Python, Java, C, C++, C#, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
				I have a very strong level of comfort with bash and terminal usage. In particular, I really enjoy writing software and learning to use tools like 
				vim to increase my workflow as much as possible.
