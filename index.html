        <div class="about">
            </br>
            <p> I'm a software engineer based in Indiana who will be graduating from Indiana University with a MS in Computer Science and a BS in Computer Science in May 2022. I've been programming for about 7 years now, and I'm ready to get my hands dirty with actual industry work. 
            </p>
            </br>
            <p> I'm more of a backend guy, but I have some full-stack experience. My strongest languages are Java, C, and Python. I have a few projects you can find at my <a href="https://www.github.com/isaiahsherfick">Github.</a> My favorite environment to work in is a Linux shell running Vim, but I still have plenty of experience using tools like Visual Studio and IntelliJ. During my time at school, my favorite topics were design patterns, software engineering, and low-level C stuff (networks and OSes). 
            </p>

            I minored in music studies while at IU. I'm a guitarist with a bit of classical training. I also play the harmonica and attempt to sing from time to time. Some favorite artists of mine include Bob Dylan, Frank Zappa, Radiohead, Steely Dan, Kanye West, Ween, and Joni Mitchell.
