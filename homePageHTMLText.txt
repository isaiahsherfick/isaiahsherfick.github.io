			A little about me
		</h3>
			<p class="aboutMe">
			I grew up in Martinsville, Indiana. Computers have always been a huge part of my life. Ever since I was a toddler, I was always inseparable from computers, whether the culprit was video games, browsing the web, or just tinkering with the system. As I grew older, I realized that computers are what I want my life to be dedicated to. I want to be one of the people affecting the way our computers fundamentally function somehow. My lifelong goal is to pursue a career in computer-related fields. I plan on trying out everything from security to game development and seeing what I really enjoy before settling into a long-term career. Today, I'm studying at Indiana University Bloomington.

			The degree I'm working towards
		</h3>
			<p>
			I'm currently working towards a B.S. in Computer Science from the School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at Indiana University with specializations in Security and Systems. If I can maintain the pace I currently am, I'll be aule to obtain my Master's in Computer Science with one extra semester of school, and that's my ultimate goal.

		<bl>
			<li>
				Go into software engineering
			</li>
			<li>
				Expand my knowledge of how computers function at the most fundamental level
			</li>
			<li>
				Go into web development
			</li>
			<li>
				Learn more about how everything is connected together and operates in unison
			</li>
			<li>
