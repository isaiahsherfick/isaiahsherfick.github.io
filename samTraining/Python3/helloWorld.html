			Alright. This is gonna be a leap. We're gonna try to learn Python. Python is a programming language that has skyrocketed in popularity in recent years due to its gracefully simple syntax. (That means it's really easy to read and write). Just for starters, we're going to write a "Hello World!" program. This program does one simple thing: it prints "Hello World!" to the console. This is gonna be scary, I know, but I'll hold your hand the whole way.

		<ol>
			<li>
				Open your <strong>terminal</strong> by hitting ctrl+alt+t on the keyboard.
			</li>
			<li>
				(Only do this one time) Create a new <strong>directory</strong>(folder) by inputting "mkdir python" and hitting enter.
			</li>
			<li>
				Go into your new python directory by inputting "cd python" and hitting enter.
			</li>
			<li>
				Now that you're in your python directory, input "nano helloworld.py." This will open the nano text editor and create a new file, helloworld.py.
			</li>
			<li>
				In nano, type in " print("Hello World!") ". This is the only line of code you need for this program.
			</li>
			<li>
				Now, hit ctrl+o followed by enter to save the file, then hit ctrl+x to exit nano. 
			</li>
			<li>
				After exiting nano, you should be in your python directory still. Run the command "python3 helloworld.py". This should run your code.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you did everything correctly, "Hello World!" should be printed to the terminal.
			</li>

			I know this is a lot. If you get stuck, I'll help you get it figured out when I come down this weekend. Good luck!
