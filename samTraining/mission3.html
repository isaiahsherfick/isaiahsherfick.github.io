		Next, I want you to take a screenshot with your computer. This can be done with the "Print Screen" key on your keyboard, according to a quick Google search I performed. After you press the <strong>print screen</strong> key, something should pop up asking you where you'd like to save the image and what you'd like to name it. This part doesn't matter, as long as <i>you</i> know where it is and what you've saved it as. Send me this screenshot via email. You can <strong>attach</strong> files to emails by clicking on the paperclip icon when creating the email. Good luck.
