		For mission 4, I would like you to print the screenshot you took in mission 3. The screenshot should still be located in the same place you saved it to originally. In order to print the screenshot, you will need to do the following:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				First, make sure the printer is turned on.
			</li>
			<li>
				Next, open your email and compose a new email.
			</li>
			<li>
				Attach the screenshot to the email like you did when you sent me the screenshot. You can leave the subject and body of the email blank.
			</li>
			<li>
				Finally, email the screenshot to "idshp85acic27@hpeprint.com". (I recommend copy/pasting the email address; it's a garbled mess).
			</li>
			<li>
				Now, just wait a few minutes, and you should hear the printer fire up!
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p class="missionText">
		When you have completed this mission, send me an email. Good luck!
