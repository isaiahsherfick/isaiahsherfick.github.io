		For mission 5, I wanted to keep things simple while still teaching you new skills. Mission 5 is comprised of a few steps. At the end of the mission, you'll have a wireless mouse and keyboard delivered to the house so you can use your computer from the comfort of the couch!

		<ol>
			<li>
				Create an Amazon.com account <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ap/register?_encoding=UTF8&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.mode=checkid_setup&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0&openid.ns.pape=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fextensions%2Fpape%2F1.0&openid.pape.max_auth_age=0&openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fyourstore%2Fhome%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dnav_newcust">here.</a> They will only need your email address and a password. <strong>Make sure you create a word document in your login info folder for the information about your account!</strong>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Search</strong> Amazon for "wireless keyboard and mouse combo." I found a lot of them for around $20, which is a really good price. In the top right corner of the page, there will be a little drop-down menu that allows you to <strong>sort</strong> the results. You can sort by price, brand, etc.
			</li>
			<li>
				Once you find one you like, add it to your <strong>cart</strong>. There should be a yellow button on the right somewhere on the item's page that allows you to do this.
			</li>
			<li>
				After you've put the item in your cart, click "proceed to checkout."
			</li>
			<li>
				Once you're in the checkout, you'll need to enter our shipping information (our address). Click <i>deliver to this address</i> once you've entered that information.
			</li>
			<li>
				Next, you'll need to choose your <strong>shipping options</strong>. I personally recommend just going with the cheapest / free option (which should be selected by default).
			</li>
			<li>
				Finally, you'll need to enter the payment information. Here's the scary part. Ask Mammaw for the debit card. Enter the information exactly as it appears on the card. Once you're finished, click "Continue" on the right.
			</li>
			<li>
				Now just review the order, make sure everything is right, and place it!
			</li>
		</ol>

			When you've done this, take a <strong>screenshot</strong> of your confirmation page and email it to me. Good luck!
