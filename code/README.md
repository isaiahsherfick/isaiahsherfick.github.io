# arouga
A text game I've decided to name arouga while it's still in development because I have no clue what it's about so I named it after the sound that cars made in old cartoons.

disgusting_spaghetti_game.py is the super early alpha build for the game. Don't look at it. It's gross. I made it when I was a naive young man.
