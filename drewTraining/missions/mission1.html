			Just to make sure I know you're good enough with loops, for your first mission, I need you to write a simple python script that does two things: first, it needs to use a <strong>while loop</strong> to print the numbers 1, 3, 5, and 7 to the console. Then, I need you to use a <strong>for loop</strong> to print every number between 1 and 10 to the console. Make every value a variable, and encapsulate the two loops within their own functions. Then, create a function called main() where you call the two other functions you've created. At the bottom of your code, you should have a single call to main(). This might seem stupid, but it's basically how most other languages work, and it's just good practice. It isn't in any way necessary. When you are done, save your file as mission1.py and email it to isaiahsherfick8@gmail.com.
