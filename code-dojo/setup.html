        To get started, you're not actually going to do any coding yet. What this initial module will cover is just setting up your development environment (most of which I've already done for you) and familiarizing yourself with some of the tools you'll be using. Now, the curriculum I have in mind for you is a little unconventional. Most coding courses start out really holding your hand and letting you stay in cozy little Windows land where everything has a graphical interface and you can use a mouse.... We're not gonna do that here. We're going back to the 70's to start out. Trust me that this will all be incredibly helpful in the long run though it may seem weird and unfamiliar at first.

        <p>You're going to be using the<em>secure shell</em>protocol to remotely connect to a small computer running in my house. You'll do this via the <em>git bash</p>
